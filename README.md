### How to enter and edit your Text and Formulas by making a basic table
  

  ```html
  <div class="container">
    <h1>Anisul Islam</h1>
    <p>Born To Teach.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Soluta,
      repudiandae laboriosam? Odit repudiandae beatae eius modi sapiente eveniet
      exercitationem illum.
    </p>
  </div>
  ```
  
In this section I have discussed about very basic terms by making a table that is based on practical life. There are two references which are relative cell reference and absolute cell reference that I have cleared by calculating percentages. What are the difference between euro and dollar, how can you add your currency, how can increase or discrease digites (cents) after main amount and how to calculate the total amount are shown during the whole section. You can go through my youtube channel and watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLGENkmWqNM&t=2s
