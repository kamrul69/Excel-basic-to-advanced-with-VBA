 3. <b>Sorting a list deals with multi- level sort:</b> Really great opportunity for us, by this option we can sort multi levels at the same time. Here I use level 1 as Last Name as ascending order then I sort level 2 as First Name also as ascending order. Here important thing is at first level 1 is sorted then level 2. If level 1 has the same multiple time, in that time level 2 is sorted first as ascending order. Since same name work as a group in a level.
