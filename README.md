### Working with an excel list
Here I am using <i>Excel Exercises 1.xlsx</i> file.

 1. <b>Understanding excel list sturcture:</b> For well planned list structure you have to make sure there is no empty column or row in your worksheet.
 2. <b>Sorting a list using single level sort:</b> To do this just go to under <b>Data</b>. Then you will get an option which is sort. Then just click it whatever you want as ascending or descending. 
 3. <b>Sorting a list deals with multi- level sort:</b> Really great opportunity for us, by this option we can sort multi levels at the same time. Here i use level 1 as Last Name as ascending order then i sort level 2 as First Name also as ascending order. Here important thing is at first level 1 is sorted then level 2. If level 1 has the same multiple time, in that time level 2 is sorted first as ascending order. Since same name work as a group in a level.
